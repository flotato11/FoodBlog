        2 Large Eggs <br>

        2 tsp Coffee <br>

        Preheat oven to 360 degrees. If you have convection, use it. Soften butter for 15 seconds in the microwave. In the bowl of a stand mixer,
        cream together the butter and both sugars until fully combined. Add the eggs, and mix until just incorporated. <br><br>Add the vanilla, orange,
        coffee, baking soda, and salt. Mix until fully combined. <br><br>Add flour in iterations of 1 cup. The dough should be slightly sticky when pressed.
        Take a spoonful and tilt it; the dough should stick to the spoon completely, not fall down. You may find that less that 3 cups of flour gives
        better dough, so add the last cup in smaller iterations. <br><br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and scoop balls of dough of about 2.5 tbsp
        each, 6 cookies per batch. Bake for between 8 and 10 minutes, then let cool for at least 2 minutes on the baking sheet.

        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Special Materials</span> <br>
        a 9- to 9 1/2-inch (24-cm) springform pan <br>
        <br>
        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Crust</span> <br>
        1 1/3 cups finely ground Graham Cracker Crumbs (5 oz) <br>
        1/3 cup Sugar <br>
        1/8 teaspoon Salt <br>
        8 tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted <br>
        <br>
        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Filling</span> <br>
        3 (8-oz) packages Cream Cheese, softened<br>
        1/3 cup Sugar <br>
        3 large Eggs <br>
        3/4 cup Sour Cream <br>
        1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract <br>
        <br>
        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Toppings (Optional)</span> <br>
        1/2 cup Raspberries <br>
        1/2 cup Blackberries <br>

      </h2>
      <p class = "recipe-instructions">

        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Crust</span> <br>

        Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Melt butter (about 45-60 seconds in the microwave.) Stir together crust ingredients in a bowl, then press onto the bottom of the springform pan. Place the springform pan in a shallow baking pan and bake for 10 minutes, then cool the crust completely in springform pan on a rack.<br><br>

        <span style="border-bottom: 0.11em solid; font-weight: bold;">Filling</span> <br>

        Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Beat together cream cheese and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth (about 1 to 2 minutes.) Reduce speed to low and add in eggs, one at a time. Beat in sour cream and vanilla until combined. <br><br>

        Pour the filling into the crust (make sure it has cooled first.) <br><br>

        Bake cheesecake until set 1 1/2 inches from the edge, but the center trembles when the pan is gently shaken (about 75 minutes.) The center of the cake will be loose, but it will continue to set as it cools. Transfer the springform pan to a rack and immediately run a knife around the top edge of the cake to loosen it. Cool completely for about 2 hours, then chill (unconvered) at least 4 hours. Remove the side of the springform pan before serving. <br><br>
